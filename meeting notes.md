Introduce channels etc slowly

start deomonstrating with 2 processes in seq and parallel (they just run it and see)

4 blocks each waiting for a different key input
only in parallel will they be able to receive in any order

Make them implement not-growing snake

What to reference... intro to go?

Basically introducnig them to the idea that things can run in parallel and then how should they communicate without race conditions (With channels)

For the "moveot background" thing - describe the langauge/tool in the background, and its usage in the implementation chapter
