# Boccam - Browser interpreter for Occam 

## issues

- EOF-related parsing/lexing problem. Actually there seem to be a lot of problems here related to trailing spaces and such.
- Should have initially defined things like TRUE, FALSE, which are protected values.
- We need some refactoring wrt how errors are handled, at the moment there is a lot of converting Err to RunErr etc which could be done automatically.
- Generally the code is very spaghetti and bad.

## goals

- factor State out into another file
- keyboard and screen channels which connect into elm
- hook up with codemirror

## unsure

- changle Unrolled handling to get true uniform dist. between threads
- andThen for Outcome - Cleans up the code but it's also kind of creating its own complexity with all the lambdas required

## discussion

Thinking about whether to implement the type system from occam 2.1 so that users can easily work with strings and chars. > Enough to be able to draw primitves to the screen (maybe even have sounds) so users can make graphics easily 

Codemirror can allow some services like automatic indentation help.
